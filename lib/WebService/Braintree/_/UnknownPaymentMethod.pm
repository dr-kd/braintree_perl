=head1 NAME

WebService::Braintree::_::UnknownPaymentMethod

=head1 PURPOSE

This class represents an unknown payment method.

This class will only be created as part of a L<response|WebService::Braintree::Result> or L<error response|WebService::Braintree::ErrorResult>.  Specifically,
this class will only be created if Braintree responds with a payment method this
SDK does not know how to handle.

Because this SDK does not know how to handle this, the class will have very
limited functionality relative to the other payment methods.
