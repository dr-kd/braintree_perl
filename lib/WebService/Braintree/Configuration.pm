=head1 NAME

WebService::Braintree::Configuration

=head1 PURPOSE

This keeps all configuration information for your WebService::Braintree
installation.

A singleton of this class is instantiated when you use L<WebService::Braintree>.
You are intended to set attributes of this class immediately, then the rest of
the distribution knows what to do.

=cut

use WebService::Braintree::Gateway;
use Moose;

# IS THIS UNUSED? I cannot find reference in the current documentation for Ruby
# or Node.JS nor is it referenced anywhere else in the code.
has partner_id => (is => 'rw');

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

Get these values from L<Braintree's API credentials documentation|https://articles.braintreepayments.com/control-panel/important-gateway-credentials#api-credentials>.

These attributes are standard mutators. If you invoke them with a value, they
will set the attribute to that value. If you invoke them without a value, they 
will return the current value.

=head2 merchant_id(?$value)

This is your merchant_id.

=cut

has merchant_id => (is => 'rw');

=head2 public_key(?$value)

This is your public_key.

=cut

has public_key => (is => 'rw');

=head2 private_key(?$value)

This is your private_key.

=cut

has private_key => (is => 'rw');

=head2 environment(?$value)

This is your environment. The environment can be:

=over 4

=item development | integration

This is when you're using a local server for testing. It's unlikely you will
ever want to use this.

=item sandbox

This is when you're using your Braintree sandbox for testing.

=item qa

This is when you're using qa-master.braintreegateway.com for testing.

=item production

This is when you're live and rocking.

=back

If you provide a value other than the ones listed above, a warning will be
thrown. This distribution will probably not work properly in that case.

Management reserves the right to change this from a warning to a thrown
exception in the future.

=head1 USAGE

Do yourself a favor and store these values in a configuration file, not your
source-controlled code.

    is => 'rw',

            development integration sandbox qa production
        );

=head1 METHODS

There is one read-only method.

=head2 api_version()

This returns the Braintree API version this distribution speaks.
