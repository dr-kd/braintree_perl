    $class->gateway->us_bank_account->find($token);

    WebService::Braintree::Transaction->sale({
        %{$params//{}},

=head1 NOTES

Most of the classes normally used in WebService::Braintree inherit from
L<WebService::Braintree::ResultObject/>. This class, however, inherits from
L<WebService::Braintree::PaymentMethod/>. The primary benefit of this is that
these objects have a C<< token() >> attribute.
