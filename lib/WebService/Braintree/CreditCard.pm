=head1 OBJECT METHODS

In addition to the methods provided by the keys returned from Braintree, this
class provides the following methods:

=head2 billing_address()

This returns the credit card's billing address (if it exists). This will be an
object of type L<WebService::Braintree::Address/>.

=cut

has billing_address => (is => 'rw');

sub BUILD {
    my ($self, $attrs) = @_;

    $self->build_sub_object($attrs,
        method => 'billing_address',
        class  => 'Address',
        key    => 'billing_address',
    );

    $self->set_attributes_from_hash($self, $attrs);
}

=head2 masked_number()

This returns a masked credit card number suitable for display.

=cut

sub masked_number {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->bin . "******" . $self->last_4;
}

=head2 expiration_date()

This returns the credit card's expiration in MM/YY format.

=cut

sub expiration_date {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->expiration_month . "/" . $self->expiration_year;

=cut

sub is_default {
    return shift->default;
}

=head2 is_venmo_sdk()

=head1 NOTES

Most of the classes normally used in WebService::Braintree inherit from
L<WebService::Braintree::ResultObject/>. This class, however, inherits from
L<WebService::Braintree::PaymentMethod/>. The primary benefit of this is that
these objects have a C<< token() >> attribute.

=head1 TODO

=over 4

=item Need to document the keys and values that are returned

=item Need to document the required and optional input parameters

=item Need to document the possible errors/exceptions
